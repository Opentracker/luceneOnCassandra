# LuceneOnCassandra
=================

The goal of this project is to store the Apache lucene index in Apache Cassandra.
This means that Cassandra will serve as the medium for indexing and querying without changes to other Lucene indexing and querying APIs. In other words, Cassandra will only be used as the datastore for the index files, and the rest of the logic will go through luceneâ€™s indexing procedures.

*Apache Cassandra 1.0.8 and Apache Lucene 4.8.1 are included in this project.*


## Getting Started
Change the following configuration files in docs/apache-cassandra-1.0.8:

    docs/apache-cassandra-1.0.8/conf/cassandra.yaml
    docs/apache-cassandra-1.0.8/conf/log4j-server.properties


We have included multiple tests cases and examples to understand how it works.
You need Eclipse and JUnit to run these.

To run these examples and tests, the first step is to start the Cassandra 'instance' locally.

1. cd to docs/apache-cassandra-1.0.8/bin.
2. start Cassandra with: 
   $ cassandra -f
3. run pom.xml or in Eclipse using JUnit.
